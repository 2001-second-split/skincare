    description:
      "While retinol is often used as a catchall term for topical products containing a vitamin A derivative, it's technically a type of retinoid, of which there are several variations that work at different levels. Retinoids work by increasing collagen production as well as increasing the rate of skin cell turnover. They also help treat acne, blackheads, and clogged pores by reducing the stickiness of the cells that clog pores, as well as speeding up the rate at which the skin turns over and regenerates. Because of this, they are ideal for improving your skin's overall texture, minimizing fine lines and wrinkles, evening out skin tone, and decreasing pore size.",
